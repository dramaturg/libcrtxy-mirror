Documentation
* Installation docs
* API docs
* Comments in header file
* Man page

Options
* Allow native screen resolution (for fullscreen mode), a la Tux Paint.
* Fullscreen/window not controlled by env. vars. yet.
* Look into SDL_ListModes

Optimizations
* Create a line clip routine
* Lock/Unlock SDL surfaces!!!
* Dirty rectangles

Code cleanup
* Split code into modules
* SDL_QuitSubSystem() instead of SDL_Quit()?

Rendering implementations
* "Best" bitmap scaling mode
* Implement OpenGL for everything we will have done manually in SDL
* Support a background color map (like plastic overlays in games like
  Star Castle).  Background would hint those colors, and line-drawing
  would pick them up.  (Some special mode, alternative drawing functions,
  or a special XY_color value.)

Effects and features
* Add support for line wrap-around (a la Asteroids)
* Support repeating background patterns.
* Do blur effect
* Additive effect

Exposure
* Expose SDL surface?
