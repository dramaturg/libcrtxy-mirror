Documentation
* Installation docs
* API docs

Options
* Check for env. variables
* Check for global option file
* Check for local option file
* Allow native screen resolution (for fullscreen mode), a la Tux Paint.

Errors
* XY_init() set error
* XY_load_bitmap() set error
* More error codes & strings.

Optimizations
* Create a line clip routine
* Lock/Unlock SDL surfaces!!!

Rendering implementations
* Implement anti-aliased lines (Xiaolin Wu)
* Implement anti-aliased lines (Xiaolin Wu) - alpha against pixels
* Implement anti-aliased lines (Xiaolin Wu) - alpha against bkgd color
* Implement OpenGL for everything we will have done manually in SDL
* Support a background color map (like plastic overlays in games like
  Star Castle).  Background would hint those colors, and line-drawing
  would pick them up.  (Some special mode, alternative drawing functions,
  or a special XY_color value.)

Effects and features
* Add support for line wrap-around (a la Asteroids)
* Support repeating background patterns.
* Do blur effect
* Additive effect

Exposure
* Expose error code
* Expose SDL surface?
