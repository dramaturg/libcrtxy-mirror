Documentation
* Create installation docs
* Finish API docs
* Create man pages

Options
* Allow native screen resolution (for fullscreen mode), a la Tux Paint.
* Fullscreen/window not controlled by env. vars. yet.
* Look into SDL_ListModes
* Allow different gamma correction settings

Optimizations
* Create a line clip routine
* Lock/Unlock SDL surfaces!!!
* Make dirty rectangle merging work
* Subdivide dirty rectangles so they don't include as much unused area around
  diagonal lines.

Code cleanup
* Split code into modules

Rendering implementations
* "Best" bitmap scaling mode
* Implement OpenGL for everything we will have done manually in SDL
* Support a background color map (like plastic overlays in games like
  Star Castle).  Background would hint those colors, and line-drawing
  would pick them up.  (Some special mode, alternative drawing functions,
  or a special XY_color value.)
* Allow background bitmaps to be scaled (by percent, or set in terms of
  canvas units)...?
* Implement line thickness support

Visual effects
* Support repeating background patterns.
* Do blur effect
* Additive effect
* Add fade-out / persistence of vision effect.

Helper functions
* Add support for line wrap-around (a la Asteroids)
* Add fast fixed-point distance calculator.
* Add 'inside polygon' test (for Quantum-style games)
* Other math functions, as we think of them...
* Add line group rotation

Other features:
* Allow loading bitmaps from pixel data
* Allow 'loading' bitmaps from an SDL_Surface...?
* Add option for XY_load_options_from_file() to call a callback with
  unknown lines, so app-specific config files only need to get read once.

Desktop interfacing
* Support window class (SDL_VIDEO_X11_WMCLASS=xxx.yyy)
* Support screensaver enable/disable (SDL_VIDEO_ALLOW_SCREENSAVER=1)
* Support windowing position (SDL_VIDEO_WINDOW_POS=center/nopref/...)
* Support window icon (SDL_WM_setIcon())
* Support window title (SDL_WM_SetCaption())
* Support mouse on/off (SDL_ShowCursor())
* Allow window resizing (SDL_RESIZABLE)
