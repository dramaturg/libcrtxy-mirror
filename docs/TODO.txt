Documentation
* Create installation docs
* Finish API docs
* Create man pages

Options
* Allow native screen resolution (for fullscreen mode), a la Tux Paint.
* Fullscreen/window not controlled by env. vars. yet.
* Look into SDL_ListModes

Optimizations
* Create a line clip routine
* Lock/Unlock SDL surfaces!!!
* Merge dirty rectangles
* FIXME: dirty_all messes up bitmap erasures

Code cleanup
* Split code into modules
* SDL_QuitSubSystem() instead of SDL_Quit()?

Rendering implementations
* "Best" bitmap scaling mode
* Implement OpenGL for everything we will have done manually in SDL
* Support a background color map (like plastic overlays in games like
  Star Castle).  Background would hint those colors, and line-drawing
  would pick them up.  (Some special mode, alternative drawing functions,
  or a special XY_color value.)
* Allow background bitmaps to be scaled (by percent, or set in terms of
  canvas units)...?

Effects and features
* Add support for line wrap-around (a la Asteroids)
* Support repeating background patterns.
* Do blur effect
* Additive effect
* Allow loading bitmaps from pixel data
* Allow 'loading' bitmaps from an SDL_Surface...?
* Add option for XY_load_options_from_fil() to call a callback with
  unknown lines, so app-specific config files only need to get read once.
* Add line intersection test routine (for collision detection).
* Add fade-out / persistence of vision effect.

Desktop interfacing
* Support window icon
* Support window title
